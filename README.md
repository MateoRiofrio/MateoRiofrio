## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am a software developer from Vermont, who is interested in app develoment. Below you will find some of the projects. I am currently working on an [android app using Kotlin](https://github.com/MateoRiofrio/ride-app-firebase-kotlin), which is a tool that can be used to record your bike rides. Most recently I worked on a simple [timer app](https://github.com/MateoRiofrio/react-native-set-counter-and-timer) using React Native, which allows you to time and count your number of workout sets.
