## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am a software developer from Vermont, who is interested in app development. Below you will find some of the projects I have worked on. I am currently working on an android app using Kotlin that I called [Ride App](https://github.com/MateoRiofrio/ride-app-firebase-kotlin), which is a tool to record your bike rides. Most recently, I worked on a simple React Native [timer app](https://github.com/MateoRiofrio/react-native-set-counter-and-timer), which allows you to time and count the number of your workout sets.
