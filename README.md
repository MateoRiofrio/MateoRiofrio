## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I am a software developer from Burlington, Vermont! Below you will find pinned projects I have worked on. Currently I am working on a personal project to make an iOS app using Swift/SwiftUI and the Spotify API, here is a [link](https://github.com/MateoRiofrio/swift-spotify-search). I have also experimented with Android app development, and I have made an app using Kotlin and Google's Firebase and Maps SDK, link [here](https://github.com/MateoRiofrio/ride-app-firebase-kotlin). I am also fascinated by React Native and how unique it is, here is a [link](https://github.com/MateoRiofrio/react-native-set-counter-and-timer) to a stopwatch I made. Finally, I wanted to showcase the portfolio website I built using HTML and Bootstrap, hosted using GitHub Pages [here!](https://mateoriofrio.github.io/).
