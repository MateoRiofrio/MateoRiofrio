## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a software developer from Burlington, Vermont. Below you will find pinned projects I have worked on. Recently, I have been using both Spring and Angular to build a simple website and REST service, check it out [here](https://github.com/MateoRiofrio/spring-angular-terraria-api)! I am also interested in mobile app development, checkout the Spotify Clone I made for iOS using Swift/SwiftUI and Spotify's API, here is a [link](https://github.com/MateoRiofrio/swift-spotify-search). I have also experimented with Android app development, and I have made an app using Kotlin and Google's Firebase and Maps SDK, link [here](https://github.com/MateoRiofrio/ride-app-firebase-kotlin). Finally, I wanted to showcase the portfolio website I built using HTML and Bootstrap, hosted using GitHub Pages [here!](https://mateoriofrio.github.io/).
